### Project Description
We received a monolithic PHP application with multiple mission-critical services. These services had the problem that when one failed, the others did too. There was no easy way to see where the project was failing.

As a team, we identified the most important components of the application. We designed cloud computing-oriented microservices using an event-driven architecture.

For the new projects, we use Python, Flask, FastAPI, and additionally, we built a new CI/CD pipeline that reduced the build and deployment time from 2 weeks to 10 minutes.
